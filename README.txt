== Description == 

Indicates environments and can redirect or reroute Emails.

= Environment Indicator =

This plugin will help you to keep sane while working on your different environments by adding a configurable color bar to each one of your environments.
The Environment Indicator adds a coloured bar on the site informing you which environment you're currently in (Development, Staging, Production, etc.).
This is incredibly useful if you have multiple environments for each of your sites.

= Email redirect =

This plugin is a great way to ensure that your users do not receive any emails while you are working on your WordPress environment.
It will automatically redirect all outgoing emails until you are done with your work and are ready for emails to be sent out as normal.
This will help save you from any accidental notifications or emails being sent out to your users from your Development or Staging environment, allowing you to work without any issues.
